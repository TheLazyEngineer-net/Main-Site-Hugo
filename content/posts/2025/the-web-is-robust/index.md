The first version of the World Wide Web was released by Tim Berners-Lee and Cern in 1991.  In the proceeding years, it has become ubiquitous to the point that it is hidden.  Despite all the innovation and additons to the web over the years, the robustness of the system has allowed for even the[first website in existence to still be viewable by any compliant browser to this day.

From an outsider's perspective, web programming seems like a chaotic mess.  Site-building frameworks come and go at the rate of iPhone versions, NPM is a [security nightmare](https://github.com/advisories), and best practices seem to be more of an abstract ideal than anything ever realized.  Despite these realities, browsers make it all work and can render nearly any page since the web's inception (Macromedia/Adobe Flash detour aside).  I have used the web nearly every day since around 2001, and in all that time, it has worked and worked well, despite we programmers' best efforts.

### What is it?

A website is a document consisting of three types of files: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  While other types of files may accessible be on a site, like media or data files, these are just rendered by the document's file type trinity.  The fancy framework-of-the-day transforms your framework code into one of these basic file types.  Today, this is overwhelmingly JavaScript in modern frameworks.  Rendering these files in a browser is not terribly complex in and of itself, but the various versions and extensions of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript over the years have made creating a browser a Huculean task through combinatorial madness.

The World Wide Web is the format by which websites interact, or how everything communicates.  It boils down to: it's [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP).  While there are extensions, versions, and other formats used, this is the bulk of what happens on the Web.  HTTP allows for communication between servers and browers to fetch and push the required information for the website.

### Why use it?

From a creator point of view, the web is an extremely stable and robust medium to create something.  All of that pain in making a browser gives us an amaing experience.  Think of the number of audio, image, and video formats since 1991 (LPs, CDs, MiniDisc, LaserDisc, good-old-film, all the digital formats...etc).  Here's the [first website](https://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html) on the World Wide Web...going on fourty years old and running fine in your browser.  If I make a website today and I host it somewhere accessible, people should be able to view it in their browser for the forseeable future.  This is the standard that has been established.  This is the standard that is promised by the current web standards.

The longevity and stability of the web is amazing.  Technology generally doesn't last this long.  It evolves and breaks the old things.  While my twenty year old C code may still theoretically compile just fine, the libraries it uses have probably changed.  It will be a question of figure it out or do a rewrite in something modern, depending on complexities.  If you have raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, your website should just work in the future, no rework required.

We haven't event discussed one of the best traits of the web: it has global distribution built in.  Unless blocked by something or mismanaged, every website on the internet should be accessible to every internet user.  The main barrier is finding it.  There has never been another medium like this.  This aspect remains truely revolutionary.
