Welcome to TheLazyEngineer.net.  This site is a repository for technical documentation and posts related to making life easier through robust technology.

Technology that doesn't work wastes an amazing amount of time.  Who wants to spend their time digging around ten year old forum posts, trying to reason with a poorly trained AI, or replacing products every five years?  Only people who like creating work for themselves.  This is time better spent.  Be lazy, avoid wasting time on these tasks.  Use better technology to avoid future work.

> Hlade's Law: If you have a difficult task give it to a lazy man â€” he will find an easier way to do it.
