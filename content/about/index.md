### Site Purpose

1. Keep missing and hard-to-find technical documentation somewhere (if I care about it) ([Docs](/docs))
2. Put to words the reasons behind the opinions that drive my technology decisions ([Posts](/posts))
3. Learn to build a static website

### Lazy Definition

The definition of the word *'lazy'* on this site is largely the same as we use in [programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation): work is not performed until it is required (ideally never) and is only performed once.  You might think this is a given, but it is not in most computer languages.  The compiler can often optimize out unused code, but, again, often doesn't for good reasons.  Lazy evaluation is often manually implemented in cases where an expensive (time-consuming) resource, like the network or a hard drive, may or may not need to be used.  Initializing these resources is often also expensive and error prone, so avoiding that work, when possible, is a nice feature.

Another way to say this is: there is already more than enough work to do, don't add more work unless necessary.  One should also eliminate time consuming, repetitive work, if possible, since it is rarely of greater value than some other, available work.  Embracing this laziness allows for the opening up of time for more useful things like community, learning, and building (or more CPU cycles and RAM).  Some good examples of this spirit of laziness are the washing machine, nail guns, and the printing press.

### Site Background

I am a programmer, so that's what I know fairly well.  However, I have always been paid to do backend work using "real" languages like C++, C#, or Java.  I then spend my free-time learning languages like Elixir, Go, Nix, and Rust.  What this means is that making a website is immensely challenging for me.  The most time that I've spent in this space is making json HTTP APIs for the front-end to consume.  I don't know what most HTML elements are or what they should be used for.  Getting something centered on a page can be a twenty minute excursion into the finer points of flexboxes.  CSS makes me contemplate murder.

All of this is to say that I have great respect for the engineers/programmers who put up with this daily and have worked tirelessly to make the web a less painful place.  Thank you all for getting us here.  This is also to say that you probably shouldn't use my website as a good example for how to make a website.  I am a monkey at a keyboard when it comes to this stuff.
