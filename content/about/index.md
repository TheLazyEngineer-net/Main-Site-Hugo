### Definition of Lazy

The word *'lazy'* on this site has a meaning in the same spirit as in [programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation): delay work until required and do the work only as often as necessary (ideally once).

You might think that this is a given in computer programs, but that's not how they generally work.  In most programs, many things are initialized when the program starts: connections to remote sites and databases are established, background processes are started, files are opened for use, initial state loaded, etc.  This is the delay that we notice when we open up a large application.  To speed up this startup time, lazy evaluation is often added for components that might not need to be initialized, so that the delay happens when the component is used.

Another way to think of this meaning of "lazy" is: there is already more than enough work to do, so don't add more work unless necessary.  Try to eliminate time consuming, repetitive work since it is rarely of greater value than some other, available work.  Embracing this laziness opens up time for more useful things (or allows for more avaiable CPU cycles and RAM in computers).  This spirit of laziness can be seen in all human tools.  We created the wheel to avoid repeated trips.  We created the washing machine to save days of hand-washing cloths.  We created computers to save millennia of manual calculations.

Humans are lazy by nature, and that impulse keeps us moving forward so that we can avoid even more work.

### Background

I am a programmer by trade who dabbles in other, tangential domains.  I have always been paid to do backend work using languages like C++, C#, or Java.  In my free time, I spent time with newer languages that peaked my fancy, like Elixir, Go, and Rust.  Beyond programming, I also know quite a bit about systems administration and computer hardware.  More recently, I become interested in electronics, microcontrollers, and circuit design.

When it comes to the web realm of programming, I am a luddite.  I have never been paid a salary to touch Javascript (in fact I made it clear a few times that I would prefer not to touch it).  The most time that I've spent in this space is making JSON HTTP APIs for the front-end because they needed some data presented in a different way.  I don't know what most HTML elements are or what they should be used for.  Javascript seems like an inside joke for programmers that went awry.  Getting something positioned where I want on a site can be a twenty minute excursion into the finer points of flexboxes, making me question at least three times whether I should have use grids.

All of this is to say that I have great respect for the engineers/programmers who put up with this daily and have worked tirelessly to make the web a reasonably nice place to operate.  Thank you all for getting us here.  This is also to say that you probably shouldn't use my website as a good example for how to make a website.  There are many people far more qualified; I am a monkey at a keyboard in this domain.
