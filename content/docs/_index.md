### Introduction

This is a collection technical documentation for things that are poorly documented elsewhere.  This may take the form of link aggregation of other documentation, step-by-step instructions, and general explainations of technical concepts.

### Subsections

* [Automation](automation) - Home automation within the orbit of Home Assistant.
* [Energy Systems](energy-systems) - Mostly related to off-grid battery backup.
* [Linux](linux) - A large topic, so there are many subheadings.  NixOS is a central theme.
