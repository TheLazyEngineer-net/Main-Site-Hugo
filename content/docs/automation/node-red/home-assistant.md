Node-Red can interact directly with Home Assistant through a [websocket palette](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-home-assistant-websocket) Home Assistant comes with an official Node-Red addon, which configures the Home Assistant palette within Node-Red.  This means it just works, without any API keys or any other fuss.
